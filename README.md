# portfolio

## Process
My process for creating this portfolio involved several steps:

Planning: I started by thinking about what I wanted to showcase on my portfolio, and what information I wanted to include. I also considered the design and layout of the site. In the end, I decided to show my web design service and Photography service for my potfolio

Development: I creat the site using HTML, CSS, and bootstrap. I used a responsive design approach to ensure that the site looks great on all screen sizes.

## Challenges
Design: I am not a designer, so coming up with a design for the site was challenging. I overcame this challenge by looking at other portfolios for inspiration and focusing on simplicity and usability.
I spent a lot of time tweaking the layout and adjusting the styles to ensure that the website looked great on all screen sizes.

## Lessons Learned
Through creating my portfolio, I learned a lot about web development and design. The importance of responsive design and accessibility
